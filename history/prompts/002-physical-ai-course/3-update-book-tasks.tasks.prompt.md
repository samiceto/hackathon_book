## Prompt

the tasks.md file contain unnessesory data update it with """ # Task List: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book (Phase 1 Only)

**Feature**: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Simulated Brains to Walking Bodies
**Feature Branch**: `002-physical-ai-book`
**Created**: 2025-12-12
**Status**: In Progress

## Implementation Strategy

This conceptual book will take readers from basic understanding of humanoid robotics to comprehensive knowledge of the 2025–2026 embodied-AI concepts without requiring software or hardware setup. The implementation follows an MVP-first approach with incremental delivery of content.

### MVP Scope
Deliver the complete conceptual book covering:
- Foundations
- [ ] T009 Define progressive complexity approach across chapters
- [ ] T010 Define sim-to-real awareness framework (conceptual)
- [ ] T011 Create safety and ethics framework
- [ ] T012 Design conceptual capstone: "From voice command → AI planning → robot action"
- [ ] T013 Establish hardware explanation approach (high-level, conceptual)
- [ ] T014 Create tool and technology clarity framework
- [ ] T015 Establish future-proof knowledge approach (conceptual, 2025-relevant)

---

## Phase 3: Chapter Writing & Conceptual Exercises

### Goal
Deliver all chapters with conceptual explanations and exercises or thought experiments.

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] T016 Create Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics
- [ ] T017 Create Chapter 2: Core Concepts in Robot Middleware
- [ ] T018 Create Chapter 3: Human-Centered Design Principles
- [ ] T019 Create Chapter 4: Digital Twins and Physics Simulation Concepts
- [ ] T020 Create Chapter 5: Conceptual Overview of Simulation Technologies
- [ ] T021 Create Chapter 6: Sensor Integration Concepts
- [ ] T022 Create Chapter 7: Basic Cognitive Models for Humanoids
- [ ] T023 Create Chapter 8: Human-Robot Interaction Principles
- [ ] T024 Create Chapter 9: Introduction to Movement Control
- [ ] T025 Create Chapter 10: Balance and Stability Concepts
- [ ] T026 Create Chapter 11: Path Planning and Navigation Basics
- [ ] T027 Create Chapter 12: Integrating Physical AI Components
- [ ] T028 Create Chapter 13: Ethical Considerations and Future Outlook
- [ ] T029 Develop exercises and thought experiments for each chapter (conceptual only)
- [ ] T030 Create diagrams and visual aids for each chapter

---

## Phase 4: Final Review & Polish

### Goal
Ensure the book is clear, self-contained, and conceptually accurate.

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] T031 Conduct expert review of conceptual explanations
- [ ] T032 Validate all exercises and diagrams are understandable without hardware/software
- [ ] T033 Ensure adherence to constitution principles
- [ ] T034 Perform final editing and quality check
- [ ] T035 Prepare book for publication (conceptual readiness)

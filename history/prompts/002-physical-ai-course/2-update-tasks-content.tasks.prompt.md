## Prompt

## Response snapshot

Updated the tasks.md file to align with the updated constitution.md, spec.md, and plan.md files. The tasks have been restructured to focus on creating a conceptual book about Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics rather than a hands-on course. The new tasks follow the user stories from the spec.md and incorporate the principles from constitution.md, organized into phases with proper task IDs, story labels, and parallelization markers.

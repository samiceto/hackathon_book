## Original Prompt
$ARGUMENTS

## Response Summary
Successfully created comprehensive task list (tasks.md) for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Capstone Course with 87 tasks organized across 5 phases:

- Phase 1: Setup (8 tasks) - Project initialization and environment setup
- Phase 2: Foundational Course Elements (9 tasks) - Core curriculum framework
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Complete 13-Week Curriculum (25 tasks) - P1 priority
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - Student-Friendly Learning Path (15 tasks) - P2 priority
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - Real-Time Performance Deployment (15 tasks) - P3 priority
- Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (15 tasks)

All tasks follow required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. Tasks are organized by user story priority and include parallel execution opportunities marked with [P] flag. Implementation strategy follows MVP-first approach with clear independent test criteria for each phase.

## Outcome
Complete task list generated and saved to specs/002-physical-ai-course/tasks.md, ready for implementation phase with proper structure and traceability to user stories.

# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Simulated Brains to Walking Bodies. This conceptual book is designed for university department heads, lab directors, and bootcamp founders who want to understand humanoid robotics concepts in 2025–2026.

## About This Book

This book delivers conceptual understanding of humanoid robotics, including simulation and optional hardware discussion. You'll explore the modern 2025–2026 embodied-AI stack concepts: ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Nav2, Vision-Language-Action models, and Jetson edge deployment (conceptually).

### What You'll Learn

- Core concepts in robot middleware
- Human-centered design principles for robotics
- Digital twins and physics simulation concepts
- Sensor integration and cognitive models
- Locomotion and control concepts
- Ethical considerations in humanoid robotics

### How to Use This Book

This book is designed to be self-contained and does not require installation of any software or hardware. Each chapter includes thought experiments and conceptual exercises that enable you to reason through robotics problems without requiring physical implementation.

## Target Audience

This book is written for readers with Python and basic ML knowledge but no prior robotics experience. The content connects concepts to real humanoid/embodied systems while maintaining accessibility for beginners.

## Book Structure

The book is organized into five main parts:

1. **Foundations** - Basic concepts and principles
2. **Simulation Awareness** - Digital twins and physics simulation
3. **Perception & Cognitive Models** - Sensing and understanding
4. **Locomotion & Control Concepts** - Movement and navigation
5. **Conceptual Capstone** - Integration and future considerations

Let's begin our journey into the fascinating world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## About This Book

This conceptual book delivers understanding of humanoid robotics without requiring software or hardware setup. Each chapter includes thought experiments and conceptual exercises that enable you to reason through robotics problems without requiring physical implementation.

The book covers the modern 2025–2026 embodied-AI stack concepts: ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Nav2, Vision-Language-Action models, and Jetson edge deployment (conceptually).

## Target Audience

This book is written for readers with Python and basic ML knowledge but no prior robotics experience. The content connects concepts to real humanoid/embodied systems while maintaining accessibility for beginners.

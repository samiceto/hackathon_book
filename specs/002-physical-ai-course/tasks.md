## Implementation Strategy

This conceptual book will take readers from basic understanding of humanoid robotics to comprehensive knowledge of the 2025–2026 embodied-AI concepts **without requiring software or hardware setup**. The implementation follows an MVP-first approach with incremental delivery of content.

### MVP Scope
Deliver the complete conceptual book covering:
- Foundations
- Simulation awareness (conceptual)
- Perception & cognitive models
- Locomotion & control concepts
- Ethical considerations
- Conceptual capstone narrative

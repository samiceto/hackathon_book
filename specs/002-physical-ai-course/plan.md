## Risk Mitigation (Book-Focused)

- **Conceptual Gaps**: Use iterative reviews and expert feedback to ensure completeness.
- **Exercise Relevance**: Pilot exercises with target audience or colleagues to ensure they are understandable without hardware.
- **Timeliness**: Maintain consistent writing schedule to meet deadlines.
- **Clarity & Accuracy**: Technical advisors review chapters for correctness of high-level concepts.
